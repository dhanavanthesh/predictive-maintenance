# Voice Alert & Information Panel Updates

## Summary of Changes

This update improves the voice alert system and adds an educational information panel for professors and evaluators.

---

## 1. Voice Alert Improvements ✅

### Changes Made in `AlertPopup.js`:

**Before:**
- Generic warning message
- Too fast speech rate
- No voice selection
- Message: "Warning! Alert! Sound level is 450 decibels..."

**After:**
- Professional, clear message
- Slower speech rate (0.9x) for better clarity
- Automatic voice selection (prefers Google/Microsoft voices)
- Message: "Alert! Predictive Maintenance System Warning. Abnormal sound detected at 450 decibels, High temperature detected at 35 degrees celsius. Please inspect the equipment immediately."

### Technical Improvements:

```javascript
// Voice Settings
utterance.rate = 0.9;        // Slower for clarity (was 1.0)
utterance.pitch = 1.1;       // Professional tone (was 1.2)
utterance.volume = 1.0;      // Maximum volume (unchanged)
```

**Voice Selection Logic:**
- Automatically finds and uses the best available English voice
- Prefers Google or Microsoft voices for clarity
- Falls back to system default if needed

### New Alert Messages:

| Condition | Voice Message |
|-----------|---------------|
| Sound Alert | "Abnormal sound detected at X decibels" |
| Temperature Alert | "High temperature detected at X degrees celsius" |
| Vibration Alert | "Excessive vibration detected" |
| Multiple Alerts | All conditions listed with commas |

**Example:**
> "Alert! Predictive Maintenance System Warning. Abnormal sound detected at 450 decibels, Excessive vibration detected. Please inspect the equipment immediately."

- Smooth animation

**📚 Content Sections:**

1. **What is Predictive Maintenance?**
   - Definition and explanation
   - Comparison with reactive and preventive maintenance
   - Benefits of early detection

2. **How Does This System Work?**
   - Sensor descriptions:
     - 🔊 Sound Level (LM393) - Detects abnormal noise
     - 🌡️ Temperature (DS18B20) - Monitors heat levels
     - 📳 Vibration (SW-420) - Identifies excessive shaking
   - Real-world failure scenarios

3. **Why Predictive Maintenance?**
   - 📉 Reduce Downtime - Prevent unexpected breakdowns
   - 💰 Lower Costs - Avoid expensive emergency repairs
   - ⚡ Improve Efficiency - Maintain only when needed
   - 🛡️ Enhance Safety - Early warnings prevent accidents

4. **Project Objective** (Highlighted Section)
   - Academic context
   - Cost-effectiveness (under ₹1,200)
   - Technology stack badges
   - Target audience (small-to-medium industries)

### Visual Design:

- **Gradient button:** Purple gradient for brand consistency
- **Section layout:** Clean, organized with icons
- **Benefit cards:** 4-column grid showing key advantages
- **Tech badges:** Display technology stack (Arduino, Node.js, React, Socket.IO, Chart.js)
- **Responsive:** Adapts to mobile screens

### Location:

Placed directly below the header, before the alert banner. Always visible and accessible.

   - Mentions "Predictive Maintenance System Warning"
   - Should be loud enough to hear clearly
4. Check console for "[VOICE ALERT] Speaking alert message..."

### Test Information Panel:

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Look below the header for "About Predictive Maintenance" button
3. Click to expand
4. Verify all sections appear:
   - What is Predictive Maintenance?
   - How Does This System Work?
   - Why Predictive Maintenance?
   - Project Objective
5. Check benefit cards display properly
6. Verify tech badges show all technologies
7. Click again to collapse

### Mobile Testing:
